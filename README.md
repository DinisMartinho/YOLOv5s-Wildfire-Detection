# YOLOv5s-Wildfire-Detection

This project involves the use of **YOLOv5s**, a **state-of-the-art object detection algorithm**, to **detect** and **locate** **wildfires** in various environments. The model has been trained on a custom dataset specifically designed for this task, ensuring that it is able to accurately recognize and differentiate between fires and other objects in the scene. The implementation of YOLOv5s is done using Google Colab, a free cloud-based platform that allows users to run and experiment with machine learning models. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for detecting and monitoring wildfires, which can help prevent and mitigate their destructive effects.

The YOLOv5s model was trained on a custom dataset, which can be accessed at the following link: <https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/wildfire-smoke>
